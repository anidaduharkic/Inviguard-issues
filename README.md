### 1. Introduction https://github.com/anidaduharkic/Inviguard-issues/issues/2#issue-2183680634

Inviguard is an advanced Management Information System (MIS) application designed to optimise inventory operations effectively. It begins with a secure User Authentication system, ensuring that only authorised personnel can access the systemâ€™s functionalities. Those authorised personnel are the employer who manages the orders from the employees that make the orders. Later on, if there is no more material in the inventory ordered by the employees, then the employer orders the sufficient amount of material that is needed.


The centralised Dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of warehouse activities, including inventory levels, incoming and outgoing shipments, and performance metrics. With its robust features, the Management Information System enhances productivity and accuracy in warehouse operations.
